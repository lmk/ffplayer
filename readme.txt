ffplayer
========

A video player based on ffmpeg for windows and android platform.

ffplayer is not ffplay in offical ffmpeg source code. It is a simple player implemention on windows vs2005 platform. It is a light weight implemention without SDL, with directly access to bitmaps and wavdev by Win32 API.

Currently, this player can smoothly play many video files, with low cpu and memory usage (compared with ffplay of offical ffmpeg), and the audio/video also synchronized very well. More effort must be done to optimize things on hwaccel, performance, compatibility and stability.

The ffmpeg share library (dlls, libs & headers) are customized and built by myself, and I will regularly update it if ffmpeg has a major release. I write a simple guide for how to build ffmpeg on mingw64 platform, you can find it on ffplayer's wiki.

The windows version becomes stable, and the android version is coming. The android verion ffplayer is working now, but lots of work need to be done, to make it better.
